"Economies have the potential to transform rudimentary games into complex systems, and if you are creative you can use them as a way to get players to interact with one another. There is nothing better for community building than an underlying economy, which makes socializing into a game." ~Fullerton, Game Design Workshop, p. 146

I used https://academy.zenva.com/course/player-trading-using-azure-playfab/ to practice creating an economy to create player interaction. This development was to practise cloud base scripting, some other concepts, and to see an example of a way to have players interact with one anouther.
